    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cool recipe that I never ate, maybe one day will, who knows?</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1-2 Thai chillies</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp palm sugar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp lime juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp +1 tsp fish sauce</li>
        <br>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 small red onion</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cilantro</li>
        <li>1/4 cup roasted peanuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the chilies to a mortar and pestle and pound until fine. Add the palm sugar and pound to dissolve into a thick paste. Add the lime juice and fish sauce and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>In a wok or an small non-stick frying pan, add about a quarter inch of oil. Heat the oil over medium high heat until very hot (you can add a little piece of onion as a heat tester, and once it's bubbling excitedly, the oil is ready to go.)</li>
        <li>Crack one egg into the oil, and if your oil is hot enough the egg white should start to bubble right away. Use a spoon to baste the top of the egg with oil as it fries, and keep going for about 2 minutes or until the yolk is set and the white is bubbly and browned around the edges.</li>
        <li>Remove the egg from the pan and let it drain on a paper towel lined plate. Repeat with the remaining eggs.</li>
        <li>Combine all the vegetables in a mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the eggs into six wedges, centred around the yolk so that there is a little bit of yolk in every piece.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs to the vegetables and pour the dressing over. Toss gently just to mix and plate. Top with roasted peanuts and serve with jasmine rice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
